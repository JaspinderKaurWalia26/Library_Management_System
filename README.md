# Library_Management_System



The Library Management System based on frappe framework,in which the Librarian can log in and manage Articles and Memberships. We will build the following models:

1. Article: A Book or similar item that can be rented.
2. Library Member: A user who is subscribed to a membership.
3. Library Transaction: An Issue or Return of an article.
4. Library Membership: A document that represents an active membership of a Library Member.
5. Library Settings: Settings that define values like Loan Period and the maximum number of articles that can be issued at a time.
